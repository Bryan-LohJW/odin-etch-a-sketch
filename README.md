This project is focuses more on DOM manipulation, including:
- creating DOM nodes/HTML elements using JavaScript
- DOM manipulation using querySelector and eventListener

CSS is also another skill that will be practiced during this project

Through this project, I have gained a firmer grasp on DOM manipulation using querySelector and addEventListener
Have also practiced flex box and using CSS to style the button and color
